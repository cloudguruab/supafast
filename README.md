## 🏄‍♂️ SUPAFAST

### 🐴 Why
This tutorial should serve as an example of using supabase api to connect to your database instance and build a service to periodically cache and serve consumer credit data on client request. This project covers redis as a caching mechanism, supabase to support our postgres instance, and fastapi for our framework, all deployed on Deta Cloud.
