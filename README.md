### üê¥ Why
This tutorial should serve as an example of using supabase api to connect to your database instance and build a service to periodically cache and serve consumer credit data on client request. This project covers redis as a caching mechanism, supabase to support our postgres instance, and fastapi for our framework, all deployed on Deta Cloud. 

### ‚òÇÔ∏è Setting up your environment

Setup your virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env 
```

Activating your environment

```zsh 
source env/bin/activate
```

In the root directory run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ü§ñ Starting Redis in development environment

### üëæ Activating your development server

To start your local server run the following command

```zsh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

On success of the commad you should see;
